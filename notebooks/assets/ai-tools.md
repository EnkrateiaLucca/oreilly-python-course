		3. Hybrid approach
- Let it see your screen - Gemini/ChatGPT desktop app
- [ ] Paste code + error ask it to debug
- [ ] When a task is simple but has many repeatable steps
		- [ ] AI to generate quick Python script in correct proper runnable format
		- [ ] copy - paste - run - finish
- [ ] When AI makes a mistake save it for later as your own personal benchmark
- [ ] Build app with AI that takes in data with a certain structure and outputs desirable output, format, etc.... then make a prompt template that produces the data into the format acceptable by that app (done) :LiArrowBigRight: example my Quiz app.
- [ ] [Ask for full scripts with uv style package management](https://claude.ai/chat/cf3cb3d1-5b3e-4ea8-8584-5b6ceada7d84)  [[executing standalone scripts in Python with uv]]
	- [another example with very little debugging](https://claude.ai/chat/3276e7df-0dcf-4159-a6c0-df0ff9601e85)
- [ ] Show LLM how to call an API (in the prompt) then ask it to create something with that api.
- [ ] Writing Python code with Claude Projects + relevant documentation
- [ ] [[meta prompts]]
- [ ] [[Context Building Workflow with LLMs]]
- [ ] [[Test-Driven Development with AI (AI Writes Tests First)]]
- [ ] [[voice driven prompting]]
- [ ] [[Treat AI models as a team of specialized workers]]
