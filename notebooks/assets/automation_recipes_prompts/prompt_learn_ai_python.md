I'm learning Python and I just covered these topics:
"""
Python syntax, different data types, variables, comparators, conditionals, writing reading files in files, working with tabular, lists, loops, dictionaries, 
"""
here is the task I want to do:
I want to automate data analysis of .csv files and create automatic reports into a .pdf.

Can you break my task down into very smaller python script/task that I can practice?
