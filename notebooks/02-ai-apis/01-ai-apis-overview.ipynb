When you want to process this information, you take the folder, look inside, and do something with what you found.\\n\\nIn classical computing, these \"folders\" are called bits.

This is similar to what happens in quantum computing.\\n\\nIn a quantum computer, these \"folders\" are called qubits (quantum bits). Qubits exist in a state of superposition, meaning they can be multiple values all at once.
