## Getting Started

1. Navigate to `01-python-fundamentals/` if you're new to Python
2. Work through notebooks in numerical order within each section
3. Use `04-exercises/` to practice what you've learned
4. Move to `02-ai-apis/` and `03-automation-projects/` for advanced topics

## Tips

- Each notebook is self-contained but builds on previous concepts
- Sample data and resources are in the `assets/` folder
- Run notebooks in order for the best learning experience
