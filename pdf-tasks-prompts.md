1️⃣ Extracting Text or Data from PDFs

Prompt:
“Generate a Python script that extracts text and tables from a PDF file. The script should use PyMuPDF (fitz) to extract text and pdfplumber to extract structured tables. It should save the extracted data into a .txt file for text and a .csv file for tables. Handle multi-page PDFs and ensure proper formatting.”

2️⃣ Merging, Splitting, and Organizing PDFs

Prompt:
“Generate a Python script using PyPDF2 to merge multiple PDFs into a single file and split a given PDF into separate pages. The script should prompt the user to specify which pages to extract and save them as individual files. Ensure the output filenames are automatically numbered.”

3️⃣ Filling Out and Signing PDFs

Prompt:
“Generate a Python script that fills out a PDF form using pypdf. The script should take input data from a JSON file, populate the corresponding fields in the PDF, and save the completed form. Additionally, the script should overlay a digital signature image on a specified page using reportlab.”

4️⃣ Annotating, Reviewing, and Commenting on PDFs

Prompt:
“Generate a Python script that adds annotations to a PDF using PyMuPDF (fitz). The script should allow users to highlight text, add comments, and insert sticky notes at specific locations. The annotations should be saved in a new PDF file.”

5️⃣ Converting PDFs to Other Formats

Prompt:
“Generate a Python script that converts a PDF into different formats using pdf2docx (to Word), camelot (to extract tables as CSV), and pdf2image (to convert pages into PNG images). The script should allow users to specify the desired output format and save the converted files accordingly.”
