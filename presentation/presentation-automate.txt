Here is a piece of code that defines a variable of some type and performs
a simple operation on the data stored in the variable
# This is data of type string!
name = "Lucas"
# This is data of type integer!
actual_age = 33
# This is data of type integer!
mental_age = 12
# our operation
average_age_between_actual_and_mental = (actual_age + mental_age) / 2
# special function that displays what goes inside of it
print(average_age_between_actual_and_mental)
# this would be a float!
# Output: 22.5

Functions are a way to group code that performs a specific task
Functions can take parameters and return values
For example, a function that calculates the total cost of an item including
tax
We could do this by simply writing a script:
# Arithmetic operation: multiplication of parameters
tax = price * tax_rate
# Arithmetic operation: addition of variables
total = price + tax

But what if I want to re-use this code for different prices and tax rates?

Here is what it would look like if we define a function to do this:
def calculate_total(price, tax_rate):
tax = price * tax_rate
total = price + tax
return total

Here is what it would look like if we define a function to do this:

return total

Now we can re-use the function for different prices and tax rates:
shirt_price = 10
shirt_tax_rate = 0.05
pants_price = 20
pants_tax_rate = 0.1
print(calculate_total(shirt_price, shirt_tax_rate))

Quiz Question 2
What's wrong with this code?
tasks = ["Email", "Meeting", "Code"]
print(tasks[3])

Answer: Index out of range error!
Explanation: Lists are zero-indexed. This list has indices 0, 1, 2. There is no
index 3!
tasks[0] → "Email"
tasks[1] → "Meeting"
