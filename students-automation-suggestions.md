would be interested in formatting e-mail based on data from a website.  for my specific example it's looking at a webpage (a bespoke project management tool) that has a table of tasks for an individual with the due date and shows if the task is overdue.  then would want to create and email to send to the person with the list of overdue tasks to ask them for information about them. (ie what is blocking the task from being completed)
