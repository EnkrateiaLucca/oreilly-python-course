In this paper, we discuss the design and whole-cavity simulation of a Multi-Beam Inductive Output Tube (MBIOT) that uses a 3rd harmonic component to the drive voltage on the grid. High-efficiency inductive output tubes (IOTs) are typically characterized by efficiencies up to 70 - 75%. However, the achievement of efficiencies greater than 80% would substantially reduce the operating costs of next-generation accelerators. To achieve this goal, we consider the addition of a 3rd harmonic component to the drive signal on the grid. We anticipate that the MBIOT will be used to provide the rf power to drive RF linacs. We discuss and model an 8-beam MBIOT with a 700 MHz resonant cavity using beams with a voltage of 35 kV and an average current of 7.25 A yielding a perveance of about 1.1 microP. We simulate this MBIOT using the NEMESIS simulation code which has been extended using a three-dimensional Poisson solver based upon the Petsc package from Argonne National Laboratory. The effect of the 3rd harmonic on the efficiency is greatest when the phase of the 3rd harmonic is shifted by pi radians with respect to the fundamental drive signal and with 3rd harmonic powers greater than about 50% of the fundamental drive power. For the present example, we show that efficiencies approaching 82% are possible. Designs for the MBIOT input coupler, grids and output cavity have been developed based on these simulations and will be discussed.
