Demo Appointment Checker - Educational Script for Learning Web Automation

This script demonstrates the basics of web automation for checking appointments.
It uses a real, publicly accessible demo booking site for testing.

Key Learning Points:
1. How to use Playwright for browser automation
2. How to find and interact with web elements
3. How to extract information from web pages
4. How to structure an automation script

To run:
    uv run appointment_checker_demo.py

    üéì HOW THIS SCRIPT WORKS
    ========================

    1. SETUP PHASE:
       - Import necessary libraries (asyncio, playwright)
       - Define async functions (required for Playwright)

    2. BROWSER LAUNCH:
       - Creates a browser instance (like opening Chrome)
       - headless=False means you can see the browser
       - slow_mo slows down actions for learning

    3. PAGE INTERACTION:
       - page.goto() - Navigate to a URL
       - page.locator() - Find elements on the page
       - .fill() - Type into input fields
       - .click() - Click buttons/links
       - page.keyboard.press() - Keyboard actions

    4. WAITING STRATEGIES:
       - wait_for_timeout() - Wait fixed time (simple but not ideal)
       - wait_for_selector() - Wait for element to appear (better)
       - wait_until='networkidle' - Wait for network to settle

    5. INFORMATION EXTRACTION:
       - .count() - How many elements match
       - .text_content() - Get text from element
       - .get_attribute() - Get element attributes
       - .screenshot() - Take screenshots

    6. ERROR HANDLING:
       - try/except blocks catch errors
       - finally ensures browser closes

    7. ASYNC/AWAIT:
       - Required for Playwright's asynchronous operations
       - Allows multiple operations to happen efficiently

    üí° TIPS FOR STUDENTS:
    - Start with headless=False to see what's happening
    - Use slow_mo to slow down actions
    - Take screenshots to debug issues
    - Print messages to track progress
    - Use browser DevTools to find selectors
